	abstract = {The similarity of drug targets is typically measured using sequence or structural information. Here, we consider chemo-centric approaches that measure target similarity on the basis of their ligands, asking how chemoinformatics similarities differ from those derived bioinformatically, how stable the ligand networks are to changes in chemoinformatics metrics, and which network is the most reliable for prediction of pharmacology. We calculated the similarities between hundreds of drug targets and their ligands and mapped the relationship between them in a formal network. Bioinformatics networks were based on the {BLAST} similarity between sequences, while chemoinformatics networks were based on the ligand-set similarities calculated with either the Similarity Ensemble Approach ({SEA}) or a method derived from Bayesian statistics. By multiple criteria, bioinformatics and chemoinformatics networks differed substantially, and only occasionally did a high sequence similarity correspond to a high ligand-set similarity. In contrast, the chemoinformatics networks were stable to the method used to calculate the ligand-set similarities and to the chemical representation of the ligands. Also, the chemoinformatics networks were more natural and more organized, by network theory, than their bioinformatics counterparts: ligand-based networks were found to be small-world and broad-scale.},

	abstract = {Although drugs are intended to be selective, at least some bind to several physiological targets, explaining side effects and efficacy. Because many drug–target combinations exist, it would be useful to explore possible interactions computationally. Here we compared 3,665 {US} Food and Drug Administration ({FDA})-approved and investigational drugs against hundreds of targets, defining each target by its ligands. Chemical similarities between drugs and ligand sets predicted thousands of unanticipated associations. Thirty were tested experimentally, including the antagonism of the 1 receptor by the transporter inhibitor Prozac, the inhibition of the 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-{HT}) transporter by the ion channel drug Vadilex, and antagonism of the histamine H4 receptor by the enzyme inhibitor Rescriptor. Overall, 23 new drug–target associations were confirmed, five of which were potent ({\textless}100 {nM}). The physiological relevance of one, the drug N,N-dimethyltryptamine ({DMT}) on serotonergic receptors, was confirmed in a knockout mouse. The chemical similarity approach is systematic and comprehensive, and may suggest side-effects and new indications for many drugs.},

	abstract = {Receiver Operator Characteristic ({ROC}) curves are commonly used to present results for binary decision problems in machine learning. However, when dealing with highly skewed datasets, Precision-Recall ({PR}) curves give a more informative picture of an algorithm's performance. We show that a deep connection exists between {ROC} space and {PR} space, such that a curve dominates in {ROC} space if and only if it dominates in {PR} space. A corollary is the notion of an achievable {PR} curve, which has properties much like the convex hull in {ROC} space; we show an efficient algorithm for computing this curve. Finally, we also note differences in the two types of curves are significant for algorithm design. For example, in {PR} space it is incorrect to linearly interpolate between points. Furthermore, algorithms that optimize the area under the {ROC} curve are not guaranteed to optimize the area under the {PR} curve.},

Similar to the receiver operating characteristic curve, the {PR} curve has its own unique properties that make estimating its enclosed area challenging. Besides a point estimate of the area, an interval estimate is often required to express magnitude and uncertainty. In this paper we perform a computational analysis of common {AUCPR} estimators and their confidence intervals. We find both satisfactory estimates and invalid procedures and we recommend two simple intervals that are robust to a variety of assumptions.},

  abstract    = "Spontaneous collective motion, as in some flocks of bird and
                 schools of fish, is an example of an emergent phenomenon. Such
                 phenomena are at present of great interest and physicists have
                 put forward a number of theoretical results that so far lack
                 experimental verification. In animal behaviour studies,
                 large-scale data collection is now technologically possible,
                 but data are still scarce and arise from observations rather
                 than controlled experiments. Multicellular biological systems,
                 such as bacterial colonies or tissues, allow more control, but
                 may have many hidden variables and interactions, hindering
                 proper tests of theoretical ideas. However, in systems on the
                 subcellular scale such tests may be possible, particularly in
                 in vitro experiments with only few purified components.
                 Motility assays, in which protein filaments are driven by
                 molecular motors grafted to a substrate in the presence of
                 ATP, can show collective motion for high densities of motors
                 and attached filaments. This was demonstrated recently for the
                 actomyosin system, but a complete understanding of the
                 mechanisms at work is still lacking. Here we report
                 experiments in which microtubules are propelled by
                 surface-bound dyneins. In this system it is possible to study
                 the local interaction: we find that colliding microtubules
                 align with each other with high probability. At high
                 densities, this alignment results in self-organization of the
                 microtubules, which are on average 15 µm long, into vortices
                 with diameters of around 400 µm. Inside the vortices, the
                 microtubules circulate both clockwise and anticlockwise. On
                 longer timescales, the vortices form a lattice structure. The
                 emergence of these structures, as verified by a mathematical
                 model, is the result of the smooth, reptation-like motion of
                 single microtubules in combination with local interactions
                 (the nematic alignment due to collisions)--there is no need
                 for long-range interactions. Apart from its potential
                 relevance to cortical arrays in plant cells and other
                 biological situations, our study provides evidence for the
                 existence of previously unsuspected universality classes of
                 collective motion phenomena.",
