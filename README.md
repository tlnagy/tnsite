Code for generating my personal blog. This blog would not be possible
without several awesome open source projects including:

- [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) - static site generator
- [Pandoc](http://pandoc.org) - the markup conversion swiss-army knife
  (indispensable)
- [jekyll-pandoc](https://github.com/mfenner/jekyll-pandoc) - to make the previous two play nice
- [Daryl](https://github.com/andrewcodes/daryl) (a Jekyll theme)
- [FontAwesome](https://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome) - icons
- [Open Sans](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Open+Sans) - clean,
  readable font

## Building

See my post [here](http://tamasnagy.com/blog/building-jekyll-site-debian/)
to get it up and running on Debian. Other POSIX compliant systems should
be similar.
