I recently received as a gift a replacement for my long deceased third-
generation Kindle. As I restart my reading habit with my new
friend, I thought it would be nice to begin keeping a reading list. One that
would include, not only what I have read, but also what I'm planning to read.
And as I move items to the "Have Read" section, I plan to write a few sentences
to jog my memory about each book in the future. This way I might be able to
stave off some of the fogginess that comes with time.

My target audience with this endeavor is myself, but perhaps you can find
something interesting in it as well. Take a [look](/reading/).
