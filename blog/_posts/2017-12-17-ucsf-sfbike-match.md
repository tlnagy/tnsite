Cycling is a great way to commute to work and to stay healthy. It is associated
with reduced risk for cardiovascular disease, cancer, and all cause mortality
[@Celis-Morales2017]. UCSF already recognizes this and [promotes biking](http://campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/transportation/services/biking) as a
transportation mode. Citywide, bikes make up about [4.4% of all commute trips](https://www.sfmta.com/blog/san-francisco%E2%80%99s-surge-biking-continues) (as
of 2014).

Unfortunately, the cycling infrastructure in San Francisco still needs a lot of
work to be a viable option for students and staff. Too many people are
[injured or killed](http://sfgov.org/scorecards/traffic-fatalities) each year on
our streets. We only have
[13 miles of protected bike lanes](https://www.sfmta.com/blog/san-francisco%E2%80%99s-surge-biking-continues)
and a single protected intersection in the entire city. Researchers in Montreal
have found that such infrastructure is used 2.5x times more often than the
unprotected bike lanes common in San Francisco [@Lusk2011]. Thus, in order to
grow the cycling mode-share among UCSF employees, university officials should also
focus on advocating in City Hall to get better infrastructure built. As the
second biggest employer within the city limits, UCSF's desires carry a lot of
weight and pushing for better, safer infrastructure would benefit the health of
the city's population.

It is especially pressing now that we have our first Ford GoBike station at
Mission Bay and we're slated to get three more in 2018, plus the first one at
Parnassus soon after. It would be a mistake to not ramp up advocacy at the same
time to ensure that students and staff feel comfortable and safe while using bike
share around our campuses.

There is already a group dedicated to promoting cycling as a transportation mode
within San Francisco, the San Francisco Bike Coalition. They
[advocate](http://www.sfbike.org/our-work/) for better infrastructure and help
train people in urban biking. They have a great presence at City Hall. UCSF
already offers a small
[discount](http://campuslifeservices.ucsf.edu/transportation/services/biking) to
join the SF Bike Coalition. I believe UCSF should go further and offer to match
student and staff donations to SF Bike. A $35 donation plus a $35 match would go
further than than a discount on the $35 membership.

Our tagline is

> UCSF: Advancing Health Worldwide

Matching employee donations would help advance health here in San Francisco among
UCSF's own personnel by making bike commuting more attractive and more common.
